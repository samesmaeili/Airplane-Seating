# Airplane-Seating

An airplane boarding program where a user can add passengers to an airplane.
The user is presented with a menu at the start of the program to either add passengers, show the airplane's seating 
or quit the program. The user can add passengers based on their ticket type such as First Class or Economy Class. 
Each passenger is asked for a seating preference, such as a Window, Middle, or Aisle seat, but First Class does not contain a middle seat. 
The user can also display the seats of the airplane that will indicate which seats are empty and which seats are occupied.
